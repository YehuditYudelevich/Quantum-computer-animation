# Quantum-computer-animation
This animation simulates the concept of quantum superposition and measurement using animated cat characters. Initially, three static cats are displayed, each with unique features. When the "Superposition" button is clicked, the cats' appearances are randomized to represent different quantum states. Clicking the "Measurement" button reverts the display to the original cat configurations, illustrating how measurement collapses the cat into a definite state.
